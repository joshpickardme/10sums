## About The Project

10sums was a practice project for me to consolidate all of my knowledge of Javascript into creating a small, simple and achievable math(s) game. In addition to this, I took the opportunity to learn jQuery as I knew it would be useful for this type of project.

What you do:
* You're faced with 10 random math(s) problems which are addition, subtraction and multiplication only.
* The objective is to answer all 10 as quickly as possible.
* At the end, you will receive (somewhat) detailed statistics of your performance. You're only allowed to play once a day (don't ask me why I did this).

Of course, to most this would be a simple 10 minute project. There will no doubt be countless of ways I can and could improve this in addition to the terrible formatting that I am very aware of.
